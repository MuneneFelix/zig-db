# Buffer Pool Management and Page Compaction Strategies

## Introduction

This document provides an in-depth analysis of buffer pool management and page compaction strategies in database systems, with real-world examples and academic references.

## 1. Buffer Pool Management

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundation

The buffer pool serves as the database's memory manager, implementing the following key concepts:

1. **Page Replacement Policies**
   - LRU (Least Recently Used)
   - CLOCK (Second-Chance Algorithm)
   - LRU-K
   - ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache)

2. **Memory Hierarchy Management**
   - RAM to Disk Interface
   - Cache coherency
   - Pre-fetching strategies

### 1.2 Real-World Implementations

#### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL uses a shared buffer pool with:
- Clock-sweep algorithm for page replacement
- Background writer process
- Dirty page writeout
```c
typedef struct
{
    BufferDesc *buf_descriptors;
    char       *buf_blocks;
    uint32      n_buffers;
    CkptSortItem *ckpt_buffers;
} BufferPool;
```

#### MySQL/InnoDB
Implements:
- Multiple buffer pool instances
- Adaptive hash indexing
- Page prefetch algorithms
```cpp
class buf_pool_t {
    buf_chunk_t*    chunks;
    buf_page_t*     page_hash;
    LRUList         LRU;
    FlushList       flush_list;
};
```

### 1.3 Implementation Strategies

1. **Simple LRU**
   Best for learning and small datasets:
   ```
   [Most Recent] -> [Page1] -> [Page2] -> [Page3] -> [Least Recent]
   ```

2. **Clock Algorithm**
   More efficient for large systems:
   ```
   [Page1(R)] -> [Page2(NR)] -> [Page3(R)]
            ^                         |
            +-------------------------+
   ```

3. **Multi-tier Strategy**
   For production systems:
   - Hot pages in memory
   - Warm pages in SSD
   - Cold pages on disk

## 2. Page Compaction Strategies

### 2.1 Theoretical Approaches

1. **In-Place Compaction**
   - Advantages: No extra space needed
   - Disadvantages: Performance impact
   ```
   Before: [H][R1][Deleted][R2][Deleted][R3]
   After:  [H][R1][R2][R3][Free Space    ]
   ```

2. **Copy Compaction**
   - Advantages: Better performance
   - Disadvantages: Extra space required
   ```
   Source: [H][R1][Deleted][R2][Deleted][R3]
   Target: [H][R1][R2][R3][Free Space    ]
   ```

3. **Incremental Compaction**
   - Advantages: Minimal impact on operations
   - Disadvantages: Complex implementation

### 2.2 Real-World Examples

#### SQLite
Uses a vacuum operation:
```sql
VACUUM;  -- Rebuilds entire database file
```

#### PostgreSQL
Implements VACUUM with:
- Regular vacuum (mark space as reusable)
- Full vacuum (rewrite table completely)
```sql
VACUUM (FULL) tablename;
```

### 2.3 Implementation Considerations

1. **Timing Strategies**
   - On-demand compaction
   - Background compaction
   - Threshold-based compaction

2. **Space Management**
   - Free space maps
   - Page utilization tracking
   - Fragmentation metrics

```zig
pub const BufferPoolConfig = struct {
    size: usize,
    num_partitions: u32,
