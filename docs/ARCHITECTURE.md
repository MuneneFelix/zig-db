# Database Architecture

## System Overview
The system is structured to focus on database development, emphasizing storage, indexing, and transaction management.

## Core Components

### 1. Storage Engine
- Page-based storage
- Page manager for memory and disk management
- Write-ahead logging (WAL) for durability

### 2. Indexing
- B-tree structures for efficient data retrieval
- Index maintenance and optimization

### 3. Transaction Management
- ACID properties
- Transaction boundaries and rollback mechanisms

### 4. Query Engine
- Basic CRUD operations
- Query planning and optimization
- Join operations

## Data Flow
1. User Input → Storage Engine
2. Storage Engine → Indexing
3. Indexing → Query Engine
4. Query Engine → Transaction Management

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient page management
- Index optimization
- Transaction throughput

## Error Handling
- Storage and I/O errors
- Transaction rollbacks
- Data integrity checks

## Future Considerations
- Advanced query capabilities
- Multi-user support
- Network layer

## Dependencies
- Standard library only
- Custom implementations for all major components

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for data flow
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory leak detection
