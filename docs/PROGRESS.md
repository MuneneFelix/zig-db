# Project Progress Log

## Latest Updates
- [2024-03] ✅ Successfully implemented dynamic memory allocation
- [2024-03] ✅ Completed basic CRUD operations with error handling
- [2024-03] ✅ Implemented file I/O with error handling

## Current Status
- Working on: Implementing page-based storage
- Completed: Basic CRUD operations
- Next: Develop B-tree node structure
- Focus: Storage engine and indexing

## Technical Achievements
1. Storage Engine
   - ✅ Dynamic memory allocation
   - ✅ Basic page management
   - ✅ File I/O with error handling

2. Indexing
   - [ ] B-tree node structure
   - [ ] Basic operations

3. Transaction Management
   - [ ] Transaction boundaries
   - [ ] Rollback support

## Next Steps
1. Phase 1 Completion
   - [ ] Implement page-based storage
   - [ ] Add page headers
   - [ ] Create page manager

2. Phase 2 Implementation
   - [ ] B-tree node structure
   - [ ] Basic operations
   - [ ] Page splits/merges

3. Testing Framework
   - [ ] Unit test setup
   - [ ] Memory leak detection
   - [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Future Considerations
- Advanced memory management patterns
- Concurrent operations support
- Extended data validation
